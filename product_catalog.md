To display a product catalog with descriptions, Jamie can consider creating a web application or a website. He can use various technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface for displaying the products and their descriptions. He can also use a server-side language like PHP, Python, or Ruby to handle the backend functionality of the application such as retrieving the data from a database and rendering it on the webpage.

For the pictures, Jamie can consider using a cloud storage service such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage to store the images and reference them in the web application. Alternatively, he can host the images on his own server or use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve the images faster to users across the world.

To manage the product descriptions, Jamie can use a database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL to store the product data. He can create a table to store the product information such as name, description, price, and image URL. Then, he can use a server-side language to query the database and retrieve the data to display it on the webpage.

Overall, Jamie can use a combination of web technologies and server-side languages to create a responsive and dynamic product catalog with descriptions and pictures.
